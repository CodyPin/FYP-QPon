# PocketBase Backend
The app would start fine without the backend, but it would be useless. 
The backend is a REST API that is used to store, retrieve and change data from the database.
To start the backend server, go into the pocketbase_backend directory and run the following command:
```.\pocketbase.exe serve --http="192.168.0.100:80"```
This command only works with windows machine, if you are using Linux or Mac, go to the PocketBase official website (https://pocketbase.io/) and download the appropriate version for your machine.
